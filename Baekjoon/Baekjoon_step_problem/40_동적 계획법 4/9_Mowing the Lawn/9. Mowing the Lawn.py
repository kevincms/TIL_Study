문제
 -After winning the annual town competition for best lawn a year ago, Farmer John has grown lazy; he has not mowed the lawn since then and thus his lawn has become unruly. However, the competition is once again coming soon, and FJ would like to get his lawn into tiptop shape so that he can claim the title.
